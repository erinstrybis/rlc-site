# In the Community

Inspired by our faith in Christ, RLC is a church engaged in the community. We serve our neighbors in a variety of ways, whether it's distributing meals to neighbors who are hungry, welcoming and supporting new Americans through [RefugeeOne](http://www.refugeeone.org) or raising funds for the relief and development work of our national church body, the [ELCA](http://www.elca.org).

For many years, RLC has participated in the [Chicago Pride Parade](http://chicagopride.gopride.com) alongside other members of the [Chicago Coalition of Welcoming Churches](http://chicagowelcomingchurches.org). We host [Wrigleyville Summerfest](/in-the-community/wrigleyville-summerfest) every summer, and we award grants through our [Mission Endowment Fund](/in-the-community/mission-endowment-fund) every winter. Although our community outreach activities are constantly evolving, one thing is constant---our heart for social justice.
