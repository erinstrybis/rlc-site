# I'm New

Resurrection Lutheran Church (RLC) is a vibrant, welcoming congregation in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. We are a unique, progressive community of young adults, families and older adults. We are a [Reconciling in Christ](https://www.reconcilingworks.org) congregation that welcomes, affirms and includes all people. Our mission is to invite, include, involve and inspire people in Christ.

Each Sunday we gather for [worship](/worship) and fellowship. Worship is traditional yet warm and relaxed and includes organ and choral music, hymns and Holy Communion. Children are welcome in worship, at Sunday School and in our [preschool](/preschool).

We profess faith in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to save us from our sins. As Lutherans, we trust that it is by God's grace we have been saved through faith—not by anything we do. 

RLC is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a Christian denomination with 3.7 million members in 9,300 congregations across the U.S. and in the Caribbean region. As members of the ELCA, we believe that we are freed in Christ to serve and love our neighbors. 

At Resurrection, you'll find opportunities to [study God’s word] (/education) and [serve our local and global neighbors](/in-the-community).

Join us for worship this Sunday at {{< worship_times >}}
