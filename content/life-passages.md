# Life Passages

## Baptism
Baptism is new birth as God's children into God's family (the church) and begins in God's unconditional grace and love. We baptize people of all ages and celebrate the sacrament of baptism within the context of Sunday morning worship. 

When children are baptized, parents and sponsors (Godparents) promise to nurture them in the Christian faith.  Parents attend a baptismal preparation class with our pastor. Parents and sponsors also meet with the pastor before the worship service during which the baptism will occur. 

Adults preparing for baptism are generally expected to meet with the pastor for ten sessions, sharing questions and conversation about the basics of the faith:  the Bible, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the Christian life and service.  To schedule a baptism, [contact the church office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com).

## First Communion
All of God's baptized children are welcome at the family table. Resurrection extends Eucharistic hospitality to all children who regularly commune. Because of differences in piety, understanding, and background, some parents do not wish for their children to commune until receiving instruction. These children are welcome to receive a blessing from the presiding minister.

Resurrection encourages all children to learn about Holy Communion. The Pastor periodically offers a class for children with their parents/guardians that is biblical, interactive and fun. The final session includes baking bread for the worship service at which class participants not yet communing will receive their First Communion.

## Confirmation
Confirmation is the Affirmation of Baptism for adolescents who were baptized as children.  Two years of preparation provide an opportunity to explore the basics of the Christian faith in a thorough, open, and age-appropriate way with peers.  [Contact the church office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com) to learn more.

## Weddings
Resurrection Lutheran Church provides a beautiful physical setting for weddings, including seating for 180, a 32 ft. aisle, and a parking lot less than 1 block away. 

Premarital counseling with the pastor is required, but membership in the church is not required.  [Contact the church office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com) to request a Wedding Information Packet and to discuss availability of dates.

_All are welcome to be married in our church._

## Funerals
Funerals are occasions to gather in mutual support, mourn the recently deceased, celebrate their life and commend them into God's eternal care.  To schedule a funeral, [contact the church office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com).  
Resurrection Lutheran Church is blessed by the presence of a columbarium, a final resting place within our sanctuary for the saints among us.
