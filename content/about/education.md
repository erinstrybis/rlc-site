# Education

## Children
The Sunday School program at Resurrection Lutheran Church serves preschool through adolescent students. September through May classes are held each Sunday from 9:45-10:40 a.m. We have a wonderful team of teachers dedicated to making Sunday School a fun and educational experience. During Sunday School children enjoy singing, learning, praying, crafting, baking and snacking together.

## Adolescents
Centuries ago, when the baptism of infants became commonplace in the church, confirmation was developed as a way to train adolescents and young adults in the basics of the faith. Pastoral instruction in scripture, the Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, sacraments and the Christian life prepares young people to affirm their baptism publicly and be welcomed and celebrated as adult members of our community.  

Confirmation is traditionally for junior high school students, though adults who have been baptized but not confirmed and younger students with demonstrated maturity and interest can also be included at the discretion of the pastor.

## Adults
Faith formation at RLC is not just for children! Learning and growing is part of a Christian disciple’s lifelong journey so we meet to explore and study our faith in conversational and supportive ways. Our Lent and Advent midweek gatherings, Young Women's Bible Study and Men's Group are just some of the ways adults engage in faith formation. Recent topics include: honoring our neighbors’ faith, Christian discipleship, book studies, world religions, faith and politics, faith and food, prayer and social concerns.  

## Preschool & Toddler Program
Begun in 1970 by Resurrection Lutheran Church, Resurrection Preschool & Toddler Program offers high quality education for children ages 2-5. Our play-based, developmentally appropriate program works to build within each child a positive concept of self and others, a sense of competency and a love of learning. Our diverse classroom welcomes children of all faiths, classes and races.
