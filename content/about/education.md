# Education

## Children
The Sunday School Program at Resurrection serves pre-school through adolescent students.  From September through May, classes are held each Sunday from 9:45-10:40 a.m.  We have a wonderful team of teachers dedicated to making Sunday School a fun and educational experience.  During Sunday School children enjoy singing, learning, praying, crafting, baking and snacking together.

## Adolescents
Centuries ago, when the baptism of infants became commonplace in the church, confirmation was developed as a way to train adolescents and young adults in the basics of the faith. Pastoral instruction in Scripture, the Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, sacraments and the Christian life, prepare young people to affirm their baptism in worship and be welcomed and celebrated as adult members of our community.  

Confirmation is traditionally for junior high school students, though adults who have been baptized but not confirmed and younger students with demonstrated maturity and interest can also be included at the discretion of the pastor.

## Adults
Faith formation at Resurrection is not just for children!  Learning and growing is part of a disciple of Christ's lifelong journey, so we meet to explore and study our faith in a conversational and supportive way. Our Lent and Advent midweek gatherings, Young Women's Bible Study, and Men's Group are just some of the ways adults further engage in faith formation here at RLC! Topics in recent years have included Honoring Our Neighbor's Faith, Christian discipleship, book studies, the world's religions, faith and politics, faith and food, prayer, and various social concerns.  

## Preschool & Toddler Program
Begun in 1970 by Resurrection Lutheran Church, Resurrection Preschool & Toddler Program has been offering a high quality education for 2-5 year olds since its inception.  Our play-based, developmentally appropriate program works to build within each child a positive concept of self and others, a sense of competency, and a love of learning in a diverse classroom that welcomes children of all faiths, classes, and races.
