# Worship 

> "Worship the Lord with gladness; come into God's presence with singing."
> - Psalm 100:2

This Sunday we will worship at {{< worship_times >}}

Worship at Resurrection Lutheran Church (RLC) is lively, blending traditional liturgy with creativity and musical variety. Our service is based on the worship patterns of the earliest Christian church, emphasizing scripture, sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion), prayer and song.  

Children are welcome in worship at RLC. Their voices and stirring add to the richness of our community's praise. We encourage families with children to sit near the front where they can see best.  

## What to Expect
Upon arrival, you'll receive a bulletin (a program including the order of the worship service) to assist you in participating. We sit in pews (long wooden benches). We sing hymns out of our hymnals (books that are located in racks on the back of pews that include all sorts of worship goodness like psalms and hymns and prayers). We stand—as able—and sit during different parts of the service. We pray, listen to the sermon and readings from the Bible, and take some time for silence. We celebrate Holy Communion every Sunday, gathering around the table where Jesus is host. 

## Sermons
What's the good news of Jesus that connects with our lives today? This is the question that Pastor Kelly uses to focus as she prepares her weekly sermons for RLC. To request written copies of recent sermons, contact [our office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com].

## Music
Music at RLC is an integral and cherished part of worship. Hymns and songs that have been used to praise God and tell the story of salvation combine with contemporary expressions to create traditional, yet eclectic worship. 

Our music director intentionally includes songs and music from various cultural and ethnic traditions in order to represent our Lutheran/Christian brothers and sisters around the world. We joyfully praise God through song and sound. 

Our tracker organ was built by Visser-Rowland of Houston, Texas in 1986 for Saint Timothy Lutheran Church, Houston. It was moved to Chicago and installed here at Resurrection Lutheran Church in April, 2002 by Visser & Associates.

## Sunday School
The Sunday School Program at Resurrection serves pre-school through adolescent students.  From September through May, classes are held each Sunday from 9:45-10:40 a.m.  We have a wonderful team of teachers dedicated to making Sunday School a fun and educational experience. During Sunday School children enjoy singing, learning, praying, crafting, baking and snacking together.

## Announcements
Every week during worship, we learn about ways we can serve here at RLC and in our community. [Email the office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com) in advance to submit announcements or prayer requests.
