# Worship 

> "Worship the Lord with gladness; come into God's presence with singing."
> - Psalm 100:2

This Sunday we will worship at {{< worship_times >}}

Worship at Resurrection is lively, blending traditional liturgy with creativity and musical variety. Our service is based on the worship patterns of the earliest Christian church, emphasizing Scripture, sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion), prayer and song.  

Children are welcome in worship at Resurrection! Their voices and stirring add to the richness of our community's praise.  We encourage families with children to sit near the front where they can see best.  

## What to Expect
Upon arrival, you'll receive a bulletin (a program including the order of the worship service) to assist you in participating. We sit in pews (long wooden benches). We sing hymns out of our hymnals (books that are located in racks on the back of pews that include all sorts of worship goodness like psalms and hymns and prayers). We stand (as able) and sit during different parts of the service. We pray, listen to the sermon and readings from the Bible, and take some time for silence. We celebrate Holy Communion every Sunday, gathering around the table where Jesus is host. 

## Sermons
What's the good news of Jesus that connects with our lives today? This is the question that Pastor Kelly uses to focus her as she prepares for the weekly preaching event at RLC. While each sermon is created for proclamation in the context of worship, manuscripts are posted here for you to read or share.  

## Music
Music at Resurrection Lutheran Church is an integral and cherished part of worship. Congregational song, through liturgy and hymn singing, forms the greatest part of our music in worship.  Hymns and songs that have been used to praise God and tell the story of salvation combine with contemporary expressions to create a traditional, yet eclectic worship. 

Resurrection intentionally seeks to include songs and music from many cultural and ethnic traditions, representing the communion of saints around the globe.  Whether piano or organ, tambourine or clarinet, we praise God through song and sound. 

Our tracker organ was built by Visser-Rowland of Houston, Texas in 1986 for Saint Timothy Lutheran Church, Houston. It was moved to Chicago and installed here at Resurrection Lutheran Church in April, 2002 by Visser & Associates.

## Sunday School
The Sunday School Program at Resurrection serves pre-school through adolescent students.  From September through May, classes are held each Sunday from 9:45-10:40 a.m.  We have a wonderful team of teachers dedicated to making Sunday School a fun and educational experience.  During Sunday School children enjoy singing, learning, praying, crafting, baking and snacking together.

## Announcements
Every week during worship, we learn about ways we can serve here at RLC and in our community. [Email the office](mailto:office@rlclakeview.com) to submit any announcements or prayer requests.
