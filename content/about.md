# About 

## What we believe
We believe that God created the whole world good and loves it deeply.  God's limitless love is revealed clearly in Jesus Christ and lived out in the Church, the community shaped by the Holy Spirit.  Nourished and guided (and sometimes challenged) by Scripture, prayer and Christian community, we live, serve and grow together in the power of God's forgiving and renewing grace.

## The Rev. Dr. Kelly K. Faulstich
Pastor Kelly joined us in May, 2015, following a long line of passionate and creative pastors. She loves serving in a congregation that has a passion for weekly worship, being connected to the neighborhood, and serving our neighbors in need. 

Born and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, she has always considered Chicagoland home. Her call to ministry began as a teenager as she became more and more involved in her congregation. Through the people in that congregation, God began encouraging and paving a path for Kelly as she led worship, organized youth events, and participated in service trips and national youth gatherings. 

Pastor Kelly attended Valparaiso University in Indiana, where she studied English, education, and theology. She spent summers working at Lutheran camps in Colorado and Indiana. Following college, she entered the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago (LSTC), where she received her Master of Divinity degree and completed an internship at the International Lutheran Church in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Always interested in learning more, she completed her Doctor of Ministry degree in preaching from LSTC in 2013. 

Before coming to Resurrection, she served congregations in Warren, Ohio and River Forest, Illinois. 

Pastor Kelly lives in Edgewater with her husband, Justin. She enjoys spending time with her family and friends, knitting, going to the movies, and drinking strong coffee or beer (though, not at the same time!). Always happy to meet you for the beverage of your choice, you can email her at [kfaulstich@rlclakeview.com](mailto:kfaulstich@rlclakeview.com).

## Stewardship
God has given us so much, we respond in love and good stewardship of all we have and are. Our Stewardship Team and ministry aims to “help God's people grow in their relationship with Jesus through the use of the time, talents, and finances, God has entrusted to them” (borrowed from Charles R. Lane in Ask, Thank, Tell). We write prayer petitions for weekly worship, identify ways we can serve at RLC and beyond, help members discern how they can live out their faith, and facilitate an annual Stewardship program every Fall.

## History
Resurrection has been a Christian worshipping and serving community since 1970, but its roots go all the way back to the 1880's! 

### Swedish Roots
Late in the 19th Century, Swedish immigrants were moving to Chicago and settling on our fair city's northside. Trinity Lutheran Church was founded by Swedes in 1883 on the corner of Seminary and Noble (now Barry). The building is still there, but it has since been converted into condos. The community at Trinity worshipped in Swedish. In 1896, Messiah Lutheran Church was founded by 14 families from Trinity who wanted to worship in English. They built at the corner of Seminary Avenue and School Street, the original building still standing and since converted into our fellowship and preschool areas. In the 1960's, both congregations begin to decline in membership, eventually sharing a pastor. The pastor at that time, the Rev. Ronald Johnson was known to neighbors as "The Flying Nun" because he would run three blocks in his worship garments from one service to another every Sunday morning. In October, 1970 - Under Pastor Johnson's leadership, Trinity and Messiah merged to form Resurrection Lutheran Church.  Barbara Johnson (the wife of the pastor) and others founded Resurrection Preschool, a program with a secular, values-based curriculum in response to a felt need in the surrounding community.

### Progressive Leanings
In 1912, the congregation at Messiah voted to allow female members to vote just as male members, making this move 8 years before the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1976, the Church Council approved the welcome of gays and lesbians into the church community, and Resurrection began hosting meetings for Lutheran gays and lesbians on the North Side. In 1984, we became one of the first Reconciling in Christ congregations through Lutherans Concerned North America. Today, we continue to be a welcoming congregation to the GLBTQ community.
