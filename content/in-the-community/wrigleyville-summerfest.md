# Wrigleyville SummerFest

Each August, members of Resurrection Lutheran Church come together to host [Wrigleyville SummerFest](http://www.wrigleyvillesummerfest.com)—a neighborhood street festival that benefits local outreach organizations. The event has grown from a neighborhood block party to a Chicago street festival that welcomes thousands of people for food, drinks, fun and music on Seminary Avenue. 

Summerfest is family-friendly and boasts one of the largest kids' zones, complete with face-painting, a bouncy house, games and more. RLC volunteers staff this event--it’s great way for us to get to know our neighbors and bond with each other. On Sunday morning, we worship in the street, singing, praying and proclaiming the Good News of Jesus Christ. 

At its core, Summerfest is a mission event in and for our community. Proceeds from past festivals have supported nonprofit mission partners like the [Night Ministry](www.thenightministry.org) and the [Chicago Coalition for the Homeless](chicagohomeless.org).
