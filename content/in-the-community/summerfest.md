# Summerfest

Each summer, members of Resurrection Lutheran Church come together to host Summerfest---a street festival on Seminary Avenue that benefits local organizations. The event has grown from humble beginnings to welcome hundreds of people for food, drinks, fun and music on Seminary Avenue. SummerFest includes children's activities and entertainment during the day, vendors, great music, games, food, beer and more.
