# Mission Endowment Fund

Resurrection Lutheran Church administers funds to a number of organizations and ministries working to serve neighbors locally and globally. Thanks to the generous gifts we received from the estates of Irving Anderson and Frank Thomas, and many others through the years, Resurrection Lutheran Church was able to establish the Mission Endowment Fund (MEF) in January of 2002.

This is a fund that exists in perpetuity; its purpose is to secure that future generations will be witnesses to the ministries and gifts of Resurrection Lutheran Church and the ELCA.

Every member of our congregation can contribute to this important fund.  We encourage you to consider making a contribution to the MEF in one or more of the following ways:

* Cash
* Stock of Appreciated Securities
* Bequest via Will or Living Trust
* Charitable Gift Annuity
* Charitable Remainder Trust
* Charitable Lead Trust
* Life Insurance (paid-up policy assigned to RLC)
* Retirement Plan Beneficiary Designations

The assets of our fund are invested through the ELCA Foundation and the Mission Investment Fund of the ELCA.  Pending the Fund's performance, the MEF Committee, reporting to the Church Council, will make up to 5% of the market value of the entire fund available annually as grants for the following purposes:

* 30% for Mission Ministries of the ELCA
* 25% for Mission Ministries of our Community
* 25% for Ministries of Resurrection Lutheran Church
* 20% for Ministries to be Determined by the Members of the MEF Committee

Applications are accepted by the fund's committee in the fall for grants made the following January.  Grants typically average $2,000 and have gone to a wide variety of organizations and projects.
