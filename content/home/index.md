# God's love gathers us together and sends us into the world to share, embody and celebrate that love.  

We are a unique and progressive congregation within the [Evangelical Lutheran Church in America](#). Located on the north side of Chicago, we are called by God to invite, include, involve and inspire in Christ.

Our doors and arms are open to all who wish to explore our  relationship with God and what it means for our life in the world.
