# God's love gathers us together and sends us into the world to share, embody and celebrate that love. 

We are a unique and progressive congregation within the [Evangelical Lutheran Church in America](#). Located on the north side of Chicago, we are called by God to invite, include, involve and inspire in Christ.

Our doors and arms are open to all who wish to explore our relationship with God and what it means for our life in the world.

# A Warm Community

Resurrection is a warm community with a storied history and a legacy of widening the circle of the church's acceptance, from English speaking worshipers in the late nineteenth century to gays and lesbians as early as 1976.

We have opened our doors to the children of our neighborhood, not only in worship and Sunday School but also in [Resurrection Preschool](/preschool), which has been listed as one of the top ten preschools in Chicago.

Some Sundays we celebrate baptisms with water warmed by the sun, since we are the first church in Chicago with solar hot water. Every Sunday a cross-section of ages and personalities is present around the altar for Holy Communion, drinking in that deep love of God and being sent out with it to bless the world.  

We hope you will join us in worship, which is lively and traditional.  (Yes, it is possible to be both!)  It will give you a taste of our community and the spirit of welcome, inquisitiveness, passion and joy that marks our community.  Hopefully and more importantly, it will also give you a taste of God's love, that source and sacred desire of our lives that changes everything, including us.
